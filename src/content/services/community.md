**Community**

Open to all DeSo. Those that are coin holders of DeSoLabs or Love4src are allowed on the stage to speak. These meetings are task oriented, with developers raising bounty-related issues for discussion, achievements are being validated, roadmaps are being discussed and transparency of development work is promoted.


**Coin Holder Benefits**

Each user that holds onto a DeSoLabs coins are visible on a tier system. Any amount of coins held allows a user to vote in determining the priority of the bounty system. As bounties are approved there will be a queue system used so higher priority / valued requests are processed ensure the developer and coin holder community is being heard and allowing the direction of DeSoLabs to become truly collaborative.
Developers have the option to convert their bounty into a coin purchase so those being paid, have the option to earn stake in DeSoLabs through the work they are completing.
