**Submission of community development ideas (bounties)**

To be able to work towards a shared vision (especially of the UI/UX), we assume that the development activity is driven primarily by the developers participating in building the DeSoTech, as an open source, community effort. We use a CIP-compatible method of formalizing and grading the ideas submitted by the members of the community. This means that for the community idea to be considered, there needs to be at least one developer that is willing and capable of implementing it and creating a pull request.

To support reaching consensus as to what code is in the repository, each of the considered community ideas will be discussed and voted on by the  community developers. During this process, devs clarify the minimum reward by defining the component, scope, and difficulty of the code that needs to be created. Once the bounty is fully defined, it will be published on the blockchain in YAML.

Community members will be able to diamond and support with donations the feature they want developed by adding to the DeSo assigned to a given bounty (community idea). Development voting system will have the appropriate scale label and the correct difficulty level achieved. Bounty amounts should include a sliding scale for items based on those two elements.  Overall the voting and ranking system is designed to ensure all developers have one voice, one vote. This is intended to promote the community appeal we are looking for, build trust, and overcome any image of favoritism.

To stimulate timely execution of the process, we will deploy time-limited notifications to make sure everybody is aware of the bounty as it moves to the development queue. Regardless of the notification, each bounty needs to be discussed during a community meeting where a consensus needs to be reached.

**Development queue**

Once the idea for development is approved, the bounty moves into a development queue where devs can accept it for work. In case multiple developers wish to take on a single bounty, we will attempt to deploy it as a weighted collaborative effort.
Once the bounty is accepted by at least one developer she will start working towards satisfying defined bounty acceptance criteria in a newly created Pull Request to one of the love4src repositories. We do want to have the new code pushed to the core repos, but we can’t guarantee that happening on time and we don’t want to block the bounty.

**Code review and release**

All of the code merged is to be reviewed by kanshi or a l4s maintainer. The merge will occur only after taking into consideration all feedback delivered during the review. To make this process easier, we will be noting down a set of coding guidelines to follow.
Created code will be showcased for at least 24 hrs at love4src for community feedback before the bounty reward is delivered.
