DeSoLabs provides regonition to community nodes and node operators. 50% of the DeSo raised monthly is allocated to actives nodes in the deso ecosystem. Nodes are an intergral part of the ecosystem and should be recognised for their contributions.  The power of decentralization becomes stronger with more nodes online.
