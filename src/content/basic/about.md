**About the initiative**

DeSo Labs supports the infrastructure of the DeSo blockchain by focusing its efforts on fostering the community of node operators and developers. We do this by facilitating the fundamental community dynamics surrounding the development and operations of software backing the DeSo blockchain - recognition for contributions to the technology ecosystem of DeSo (DeSoTech).
As a continuous effort run in monthly cycles, DeSoLabs will raise DeSo through coin purchases and designated donations. All contributions are public on the blockchain to assure full transparency of the fundraising activity and its outcomes.
The account will keep the FR at ~99.99% to reduce the chance for any coin related shenanigans or speculation. Think of this account as a support and donation wallet for the community developers and node operators of the DeSo blockchain.

**Support for DeSoTech**

To provide recognition to the node operators, developers, tool makers, and to stimulate the evolution of the DeSo technology - at the end of each month, all DeSo raised will be split among all participating community nodes and development activities aimed at growing the ecosystem of the DeSo blockchain.
